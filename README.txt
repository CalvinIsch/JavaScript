Everything was completed under the guidance of IU’s Director of Cognitive Science, Professor Peter Todd. I used a variant of the language, JsPsych, to create multiple working experiments that ran 200+ subjects. Many of the plugins were developed by another developer and only received small changes for these experiments. My work is in the “FoodPopsUp.html” file. In this experiment, we compared how subjects hunger affected their perception of gross food.
